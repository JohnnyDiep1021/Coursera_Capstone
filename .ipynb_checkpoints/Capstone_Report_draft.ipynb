    "1. In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.\n",

More crucially, a number of influential factors will be **the stakeholder's affordability** for **the cost of living** and **the price of the real estate in the desired areas**. Since we primarily focus on using the Foursquare to discover the most ideal living area in this capstone, we will assume these factors are in the available budget of our stakeholders. \n",

    "- Working as data scientist, we will manipulate the power of data to generate the most feasible and promising neighborhoods based on the listed above criteria. It will be expected that the upsides and downsides will be also comprehensively listed out so that the best deliverables can be used to help our stakeholders make their final decision.\n",
