    "- In this capstone, we reach out to stakeholders who are looking for the most convenient and well-located areas with good public amenities and service in London, Ontario. Specifically, We are going to explore the neighborhoods in London and specify the number of residential areas with a prosperous economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Our stakeholders don't know what kind of effective business patterns they should startup, so they also want us to suggest some of the potential economies in the recommended areas. More crucially, the number of influential factors will be **the stakeholder's affordability** for **the cost of living** and **the price of the real estate in the desired areas**. Since we primarily focus on using Foursquare to discover the most ideal living area in this capstone, we will assume these factors are in the available budget of our stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Working as a data scientist, we will manipulate the power of data to generate the most feasible and promising neighborhoods based on the listed above criteria. It will be expected that the upsides and downsides will be also comprehensively listed out so that the best deliverables can be used to help our stakeholders make their final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project will significantly target the potential stakeholders who have a desire to settle down and run their own business in residential areas with good living conditions.\n",

    "2. How close should the living area be to the surrounded public services?\n",
